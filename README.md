# Analyze A/B Test Results
Analyze A/B Test Results is a demonstration of hypothesis testing using a bootstrapping method. The project uses Python's numpy and pandas to carry out the bootstrapping technique. Bootstrapping simulates a distribution under the null hypothesis to compare with observed differences in order to determine the probability that the observed differences did not come from a null-like distribution.
